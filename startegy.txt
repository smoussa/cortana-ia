STRATEGY (1)

- At the beginning, we don't know how much flights or hotels cost.
- We are given 12 entertainment packages.
- We set how much profit we would like to make ($3500).
- The game starts and client preferences come in.
* We sell the entertainment packages to the clients and see how much profit required is leftover (EP).
* We need to buy hotel rooms as soon as possible before the prices begin to rise.
- But we need to know how much to buy them for and this is based on how much flights cost.
- Get the clients' flight preferences (FI, FO, NN)
- Get the arrive and departure flight quotes based on the preferences.
- Calculate the utility we have left over based on this formula for each client:
	HC = 1000 - FI - FO - EP / NN
- We then get a maximum amount we need to spend on buying a hotel per night per client
* Buy hotel rooms for the nights the client is staying.
* Buy flights for the time the client is staying.
- Allocate all (with entertainment package if profitable)

Game starts, allocate entertainment tickets, ^ we then know our best clients. We then allocate flights and hotels to these clients.
We get the initial flight prices but need to buy hotels quickly based on the flight prices. Split per day.

If we can make more money selling an entertainment package on the market than the bonus amount we will get selling it to a client,
sell to market.

We get 12 entertainment packages at on av. 100 each.

3500 profit needed
12 x 100 entertainment
/ 8 (per client)

= 287.5 profit needed per client if we want to make a profit of 3500.

for each client
(1000 - flight in - flight out - 287.5 profit) / number of nights needed = amount to spend on buying a hotel per night
