Make potential future strategies in down time (ie first minute)

Multiple positions that solve the same problem dominate based not just on potential final score, but also probability of achievement (i.e how is there left to buy)

===MonteCarlo===
plot a ROC point style
plot box plot over time (y-axis is form -infinity to infinity, difference between expected min to actual min)
plot box plot over time (y-axis is form -infinity to infinity, difference between expected min to bought min) for a range of buying strategies
plot box plot over time (y-axis is Bought/ExpectedMin) to determine const for expectedBoughtPrice
Do the flight start analysis time on the fly based on data

===Entertainment trolling===
Try adding bids with quantity 0, what happens? high ask? high bid?
Add ask >200 as fine for not having it is only 200. Pure profit
Some sort of cartel with others?
