Make potential future strategies in down time (ie first minute)


===MonteCarlo===
plot a ROC point style
plot box plot over time (y-axis is form -infinity to infinity, difference between expected min to actual min)
plot box plot over time (y-axis is form -infinity to infinity, difference between expected min to bought min) for a range of buying strategies
plot box plot over time (y-axis is Bought/ExpectedMin) to determine const for expectedBoughtPrice
Do the flight start analysis time on the fly based on data
